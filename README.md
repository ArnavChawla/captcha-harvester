A python project which emulates google's captcha on a desired domain. By emulating captchas, the tokens can be used for website automation or other purposes.
To solve captchas on a custom domain add the domain to your hosts file at "127.0.0.1"
Then restart the existing program and navigate to HTTP://customdomain.com:5000

To retrive captcha results simply go to: 127.0.0.1/bank

Adtionally, to get the easiest captchas open a seperate tab on youtube then login to a gmail account and play videos in the background. This helps google verify authenticity of a human giving you easier "1 click captchas". 
This currently supports recaptcha v2.
